# Markdown with Code Example

GitHub has built-in Markdown viewers, too.

For example, you can write a code block like this:

```R
# This is R code embedded in a Markdown file
x <- rnorm( 1000 );
y <- rnorm( 1000 );
plot( x, y );

# What will this look like?
```
## Normal Distributions in R

To sample data from a normal distribution, use the `rnorm()` function. For example, `rnorm(1000)` will sample 1000 values from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
